Hi, I'm Onur, aka `csonuryilmaz`. A 35-year-old [software craftsman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship)!

Welcome to my blog, thanks for visiting.

As being an avid software developer, my blog contains some notes, how-to docs and my point of view about software development, programming languages, computer science topics and all tech related stuff.

I've started my personal computer journey with a 80386 MS-DOS (6.2x) machine. First programming languages that I learned were [GW-BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC) and [QBasic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic).

Although in the past I used Microsoft Windows from [Windows 3.11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1x) up to [Windows 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_7) for business requirements, I fell in love with GNU/Linux and I've been using GNU/Linux since 2003 both for personal and business purposes.

My GNU/Linux journey started with [RedHat 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Linux), followed by [Mandrake 10.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandriva_Linux). For a long time I used [Slackware 9.x-11.x](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slackware) and after graduted from university I used [Gentoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentoo_Linux) for about 4-5 years.

Since 2013, I've been using [Debian 7.x - 9.x](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian). This is my last stop for a GNU/Linux distribution. I don't want to change it any more, Debian is very comfortable for me.

I love open source and my professional career, my tehnical choices, my solutions to business requirements, all shaped by free and open source (_foss_) projects. I try to support and contribute to open source community as much as I can. I hope to be more productive in the future.

In the past I've used many programming languages for software development. Mostly, I worked as a full stack software engineer.

Nowadays I'm working on below programming languages:

- iOS native apps with [Objective-C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C)
- Android native apps with [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))
- Systems programming with [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) and [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))
- Web apps with [Php](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP), [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [Html](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and [Css](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) and built on [LAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)) stack

My regular business day contains below activites:

- Merge (pull) request code reviews
- White-box testing and QA
- Requirement Analysis & Documentation
- Technical Wiki Documentation
- Techinical & Architectural Discussions
- Release & App Deployments
- Application Performance Monitoring
- Application Error Monitoring
- Database Maintenance & Migrations
- GitLab, Sentry, Mattermost, KiwiTCMS Maintenance

Happy coding!
