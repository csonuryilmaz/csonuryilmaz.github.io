I use [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for static site generation. Its latest version requires minimum `ruby 2.4.0` as of now. But Debian 9.11 (`stretch`) has `ruby 2.3.3` in its repositories, at the time of writing.

```txt
$ ruby -v
ruby 2.3.3p222 (2016-11-21) [x86_64-linux-gnu]
```

Although next release of Debian (`buster`) has `ruby 2.5.1` it has not been backported to `stretch` by now.

So I decided to use [rvm](https://rvm.io/) to get latest versions of `ruby`.
> RVM is a command-line tool which allows you to easily install, manage, and work with multiple ruby environments ..

When you try to install `rvm`, it gives an error about its dependencies and there are unmet dependencies.

```txt
$ sudo apt install curl g++ gcc autoconf automake bison libc6-dev libffi-dev libgdbm-dev libncurses5-dev libsqlite3-dev libtool libyaml-dev make pkg-config sqlite3 zlib1g-dev libgmp-dev libreadline-dev libssl-dev
...
...
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 libsqlite3-dev : Depends: libsqlite3-0 (= 3.16.2-5+deb9u1) but 3.27.2-3~bpo9+1 is to be installed
 sqlite3 : Depends: libsqlite3-0 (= 3.16.2-5+deb9u1) but 3.27.2-3~bpo9+1 is to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
```

Above, we try to install the dependencies required for the RVM utility to build Ruby from source. The problem here is that, my Debian installation has both `stretch` and `stretch-backports` defined in its package repositories and latest version of `libsqlite3-0` is active which came from `stretch-backports`.

Normally it's the desired situation when you use backports repository, but in `rvm` case it makes problem. I don't guess `rvm` won't work with `3.27.2-3~bpo9+1`. It's probably because of a static definition about Debian package requirement which ignores `stretch-backports`. For example, when you're on Debian 9.x (`stretch`) `libsqlite3-0` required version should be `3.16.2-5+deb9u1`. There may be a statement like this.

```txt
$ apt-cache policy libsqlite3-0
libsqlite3-0:
  Installed: 3.27.2-3~bpo9+1
  Candidate: 3.27.2-3~bpo9+1
  Version table:
 *** 3.27.2-3~bpo9+1 100
        100 http://ftp.debian.org/debian stretch-backports/main amd64 Packages
        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status
     3.16.2-5+deb9u1 500
        500 http://ftp.debian.org/debian stretch/main amd64 Packages
```

You can continue to install `rvm` without its dependencies ..

```txt

Installation of RVM in /home/onur/.rvm/ is almost complete:

.. but practically it doesn't work when you try to install a `ruby` version.

```txt
$ rvm install 2.6.3
...

```

The only way to satisfy dependencies seems to downgrade `libsqlite3-0` package to version which came from `stretch` repository.

```txt
$ sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-0=3.16.2-5+deb9u1
...
The following packages will be DOWNGRADED:
  libsqlite3-0
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 1 downgraded, 0 to remove and 8 not upgraded.
Need to get 572 kB of archives.
After this operation, 129 kB disk space will be freed.
...
$ apt-cache policy libsqlite3-0
libsqlite3-0:
  Installed: 3.16.2-5+deb9u1
  Candidate: 3.16.2-5+deb9u1
  Version table:
     3.27.2-3~bpo9+1 100
        100 http://ftp.debian.org/debian stretch-backports/main amd64 Packages
 *** 3.16.2-5+deb9u1 500
        500 http://ftp.debian.org/debian stretch/main amd64 Packages
        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status
```

After downgrade, when you check `rvm` requirements again, its dependencies will be installed successfully.

```txt
$ rvm requirements
RVM used your Gemfile for selecting Ruby, it is all fine - Heroku does that too,
you can ignore these warnings with 'rvm rvmrc warning ignore /home/onur/github/csonuryilmaz/csonuryilmaz.github.io/Gemfile'.
To ignore the warning for all files run 'rvm rvmrc warning ignore allGemfiles'.

```

Now, you can install any version of ruby without a problem.

```txt
